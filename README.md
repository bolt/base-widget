Bolt Base Widget
================

Using this extension, you can easily configure and add widgets to a Bolt website. This can be done both in the 'frontend' as well as in the backend. 

This allows you to define specific 'blocks' for your website that don't really fit into anything else, or you can use it to render and cache parts of the page that are slowing down the performance. By adding these as a 'cached' or 'deferred' widget, the page will no longer slow down while waiting for all of the content to render. 

Some of the features of this extension are: 

 - Adding a widget with static, predefined content
 - Adding widgets that retrieve a specific record
 - Using templates to render widgets
 - Widgets can be added to both the 'frontend' and 'backend'
 - Widgets can be cached and rendered non-blocking (deferred)

This extension uses Bolt's widget functionality. For the various locations that you can add widgets, you'll find an [updated list][1] on the Bolt documentation website. 

To get a good idea of the possibilities of this extension, simply check out the [default configuration][2], which shows various types of widgets to add.

Options:

 - `location`: The location determines where the widget will be inserted in the template. For the backend there are a number of pre-defined positions, but for the frontend this depends on where the theme's author has provided `{{ widget() }}` areas. 
 - `type`: Use this to specify a widget for 'backend'. If you omit this option, it'll be inserted in the 'frontend' by default. 
 - `record`: Specify If the `content` option is also used, it will be used as a fallback for the values of `{{ record }} `
 - `template`: Define the template to use for rendering this widget. See the section 'Overriding the templates' below. 
 - `content`: The content defines the static content for the widget and is normally defined as an array. This will be passed into the widget as-is, and will be accessible in the widget's teplate as `{{ content }}`. For backend widgets, there's a pre-defined format for this. See the section 'backend widgets' below.
 - `enabled`: Use this option to (temporarily) disable a widget. If set to `enabled: false`, the widget will not be shown anywhere.
 

Overriding the templates
------------------------
This extension comes with a few default `.twig` files, to render blocks of content or backend widgets. Especially if you are using this extension to add blocks to your frontend pages, chances are that you will want to modify the way it looks. 

In one of the stock examples, you'll see: 

```
template: widgets/contentblock.twig
```

This uses the template at `extensions/vendor/bolt/basewidget/widgets/contentblock.twig`. If you wish to use your own template, simply create a folder `widgets` in your current theme directory, and copy the file `contentblock.twig` to it. Bolt will automatically pick up the one from your own theme, if you've overridden it. 

Obviously you can also give a widget another template to render, but it is good practice to keep these organized in a `widgets/` folder inside your theme. 

Backend widgets
---------------

Using this extension, you'll be able to easily add two types of widgets to the Bolt backend: 

 - Panel widgets, for the sidebars on 'Dashboard', 'Overview listing', and 'Edit content' pages. 
 - Button widgets, for almost all pages.

To add a button to the Dashboard, use the following: 

```
    # Or one or more simple buttons to the top of the dashboard.
    block6:
        type: backend
        location: dashboard_below_header
        template: widgets/backend_buttons.twig
        content:
            buttons:
                About:
                    type: secondary
                    icon: heart
                    path: about # Note, Use a route that's registered in Bolt.
```

The `location` is one of the pre-defined locations in Bolt's backend where you can add widgets. The `content` has a field `buttons`, that defines one or more buttons. In the above example, only one button is added, that's labeled 'About'. To determine the functionality of the buttons, there are four options:

 - `type`:
 - `icon`:
 - `path`: Specify a named path, as defined by `->bind('â€¦')` in the controller. This will mostly be useful if you have created an extension, and would like to add some buttons for it. If this is used, it takes priority over the `link` option.
 - `link`: This can be either an
 - `target`: Set this to `_blank` in order to open the specified link in a new tab/window in the browser.

This is the result:
